Theme: My website background picture  is a surgical operating room because Sandra Oh starred in Grey's Anatomy for almost 10 years. The div is a dark blue because Sandra Oh's character Cristina was an attending at Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital when she left, and attending's scrubs are in the same shade of dark blue.
